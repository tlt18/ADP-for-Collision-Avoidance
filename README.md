# ADP-for-Collision-Avoidance
Approximate dynamic programming for collision avoidance

### Introduction
This version of the cost function is not differentiable for actions and cannot be solved using ADP. The code is no longer maintained. 

The tracking control problem can be solved using ADP by referring to https://github.com/tlt18/Accurate-Tracking-ADP.
